## What is it?

This is a toy project, and it is not meant to be used for production.
My goal is to implement a PDF file parser from scratch in c which is conform to **ISO 32000-2:2020 (PDF 2.0)**.
I add and discover how it works by implementing it. It is not optimized, not safe, and not meant to be used.
Heavy refactor will follow as I do progress if I do progress...

I do reserve myself the right to not finish this project and leave it as it is just by pure lake of time or motivation.

## Compilation

How to compile? Nothing fancy, just compile the `main.c` file:
```
cl main.c
```
Or whatever compiler you use...
